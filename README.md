Finally in Chapters 5-7 we’re ready for our final project: a robust blog application that
demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality in Django. 
We’ll find that Django’s generic class-based views mean we have to write only
a small amount of actual code for this! Then we’ll add forms and integrate Django’s
built-in user authentication system (log in, log out, sign up).
